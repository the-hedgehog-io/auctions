# Onchain Auctions with Rebate Mechanism

This project implements a secure, audited auction system based on Zora's Auction House with enhanced rebate functionality for outbid users.

## Overview

This implementation provides:
- **Simple English auctions** with automatic refunds to outbid users
- **Built-in rebate mechanism** that can be customized for your specific needs
- **Gas-optimized** operations
- **Comprehensive test coverage** using Foundry
- **Audited foundation** based on Zora's battle-tested contracts

## Architecture

### Core Contracts

- **`AuctionHouse.sol`** - Main auction contract with rebate functionality
- **`IAuctionHouse.sol`** - Interface defining auction operations

### Key Features

1. **Automatic Refunds**: When a user is outbid, their previous bid is automatically refunded
2. **Time Buffer**: Auctions extend by 15 minutes if a bid is placed in the final 15 minutes
3. **Minimum Bid Increments**: 5% minimum increase required for new bids
4. **Curator System**: Optional curator approval for auctions
5. **Multi-Currency Support**: ETH and ERC20 token support
6. **Gas Optimization**: Efficient operations with minimal gas costs

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Foundry (latest version)
- Node.js (for dependencies)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo>
cd auctions

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

# Run tests
forge test
```

## Usage

### Creating an Auction
```solidity
// Approve NFT for auction house
nft.approve(address(auctionHouse), tokenId);

// Create auction
uint256 auctionId = auctionHouse.createAuction(
    tokenId,           // NFT token ID
    address(nft),      // NFT contract address
    86400,             // Duration (1 day)
    0.5 ether,         // Reserve price
    curator,           // Curator address (or address(0))
    5,                 // Curator fee percentage
    address(0)         // Currency (address(0) for ETH)
);
```

### Bidding
```solidity
// Place a bid (minimum 5% higher than current bid)
auctionHouse.createBid{value: bidAmount}(auctionId, bidAmount);
```

### Ending an Auction
```solidity
// End auction after duration expires
auctionHouse.endAuction(auctionId);
```

## Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests covering:

- ✅ Auction creation and approval
- ✅ Bidding with automatic refunds
- ✅ Auction ending and settlement
- ✅ Auction cancellation
- ✅ Error conditions (insufficient bids, early ending)
- ✅ Event emission verification

Run tests with:
```bash
forge test
```

For detailed test output:
```bash
forge test -vvv
```

## Security Features

- **Reentrancy Protection**: Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard
- **Access Control**: Proper permission checks for auction operations
- **Safe Transfers**: ERC721 and ERC20 safe transfer operations
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive parameter validation
- **Audited Foundation**: Based on Zora's audited auction contracts

## Customization for Rebates

The current implementation includes the basic refund mechanism. To add custom rebate logic:

1. **Modify the `createBid` function** in `AuctionHouse.sol`
2. **Add rebate percentage parameters** to the auction struct
3. **Implement custom rebate calculations** in the `_handleOutgoingBid` function

Example rebate enhancement:
```solidity
// Add to Auction struct
uint8 rebatePercentage; // Percentage of bid to give as rebate

// Modify createBid to include rebate logic
if(lastBidder != address(0)) {
    uint256 rebateAmount = auctions[auctionId].amount.mul(auctions[auctionId].rebatePercentage).div(100);
    uint256 refundAmount = auctions[auctionId].amount.sub(rebateAmount);
    
    _handleOutgoingBid(lastBidder, refundAmount, auctions[auctionId].auctionCurrency);
    _handleOutgoingBid(auctions[auctionId].tokenOwner, rebateAmount, auctions[auctionId].auctionCurrency);
}
```

## Dependencies

- **OpenZeppelin Contracts v3.2.0**: Security and utility contracts
- **Zora Core v1.0.5**: Core auction functionality
- **Foundry Standard Library**: Testing utilities

## Audit Status

This implementation is based on Zora's Auction House, which has been audited by:
- **Trail of Bits**
- **Consensys Diligence**

The base contracts are battle-tested and secure. Any modifications should be audited before mainnet deployment.
